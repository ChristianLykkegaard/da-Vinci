can be difficult to find a barrier certificate that is valid for a system, especially as the order of the system grows, as seen from the second order system

it is desirable to find a different approach to defining barrier certificates that is more efficient, and for this purpose the MATLAB toolbox SOSTOOLS can be used. This toolbox uses Sums of Squares optimization to solve problems, so it is necessary to cast the definition of the barrier certificate as a SOS program to us it for barrier certificate search. Hence the background to the SOS  formulation of the problem is presented in the next chapter, after which the SOSTOOLS toolbox is introduced, and used for barrier certificate search.
