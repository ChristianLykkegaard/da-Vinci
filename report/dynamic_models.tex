The relative velocity of two frames, meaning both the linear and angular velocity, can be concisely expressed as a 4x4 matrix (a twist) $T^{c,a}_b$, that describes the relative velocity of frame b with respect to b expressed in frame c
\begin{equation}
T^{c,a}_b = H^c_a \dot{H}^a_b H^b_c
\end{equation}
