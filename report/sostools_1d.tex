\section{Barrier Certificate Search for First Order Robot Slide System}\label{sec:sos_search_1storder}
In order to search for a barrier certificate the robot slide system from \autoref{chap:cbf_1d_static} is reintroduced, and will be recapitulated along with new notation. As illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_slide} the physical limits of the slide movement, $\pm 10$\,cm,  defines the set $\mathcal{X}$, and the unsafe region $\mathcal{X}_u$ is the upper 5\,cm of this interval. The safe set should be as large as possible, but due to the fact that the barrier certificate must have a minimum value of $\bar{\epsilon}$ on the unsafe set, the safe set $\mathcal{X}_0$ is separated from $\mathcal{X}_u$ by a small distance $\Delta$, as was illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_delta1}. This can be summarized  (with units in meter) as
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.7mm
\item Considered subset of the state space is the interval between the physical limits of the slide movement, i.e. $\mathcal{X}=\{x\in [-0.1,0.1] \}\subset\mathbb{R}$
\item The unsafe set is $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x\in [0.05,0.1] \}\subset\mathcal{X}$
\item The safe set is as much of the remaining part of the considered set as possible, i.e. $\mathcal{X}_0=\{x\in [-0.1,0.05-\Delta] \}\subset\mathcal{X}\setminus\mathcal{X}_u$
\end{itemize}
It is noted that the design criteria differ from the criteria in \autoref{chap:cbf_1d_static} given that the barrier certificate now must be valid in the entire safe region.

Using the first order linear model of the robot slide system described in \autoref{subsec:model_1d}, and  the linear position controller described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder} with proportional gain \textbf{K} and unity gain between reference and position secured by $\bar{\mathbf{N}}=\textbf{K}+1$, %giving input $u=\bar{\mathbf{N}}x_\text{ref}-\textbf{K}x$, 
the closed-loop system is recapitulated as
%i.e. for the  1D state space system with $x_1\in\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}$ corresponding to the robot slide joint being the only degree of freedom (see \autoref{fig:safe:overview} for an overview of the slide movement), thus a closed-loop system
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{align}
\dot{x} = \textbf{A}x+\textbf{B}u &= \textbf{A}x+\textbf{B}(\bar{\mathbf{N}}x_\text{ref}-\textbf{K}x)\nonumber\\
&= \underbrace{(\textbf{A} - \textbf{B}\textbf{K})}_{-\tau^{-1}(\textbf{K}+1)} x + \underbrace{\textbf{B}\bar{\textbf{N}}}_{\tau^{-1}(\textbf{K}+1)} x_\text{ref} \nonumber\\
& = %-\tau^{-1}x+\tau^{-1}u=

\tau^{-1}(\mathbf{K}+1)(x_\text{ref}-x),

\end{align}


This system is used in the following subsections in the barrier function search.
First with a reference in zero giving detailed explanations of the program formulation, and subsequently for the same system, testing for how wide a range of references safety can be guaranteed. Last, a coordinate shift from the position-reference-space to the error-space is performed in order to simplify the search for reference intervals yielding valid solutions.

\subsection{Safety Verification of First Order System with Zero Reference}\label{subsec:zeroref}
To give a clear picture of the structure of the \gls{sos} program, an initial exhaustive example is given for the  one-dimensional first order system with zero as reference position. Commands associated with SOSTOOLS is marked in brown in the following code snips. 

Search for a barrier certificate by first defining the open-loop system, and designing a controller (with pole placement) as described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Time constant from measurement
tau = 0.11;
% State-space matrices from first order system
A = -1/tau;
B = 1/tau;
K = place(A,B,10*eig(A));
\end{lstlisting}
%Define the boundaries for each of the three sets $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{X}_u$ and $\mathcal{X}_0$ as given in \autoref{fig:slide_sos}, and 
Define the desired distance $\Delta$ between the safe and unsafe sets along with  the minimum value $\bar{\epsilon}$ of the barrier function on the unsafe set. %in order to get $\mathcal{X} =\{x\in[-0.1,0.1]\}$, $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x\in[0.05,0.1]\}$ and $\mathcal{X}_0=\{x\in[-0.1,0.05-\Delta]\}$.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Distance between defined safe and unsafe regions
delta = 1e-3;

% Minimum value of the barrier certificate on the unsafe set Xu
epsilon = 1e-3;
\end{lstlisting}
%% Set upper and lower limits for the set intervals X, Xu and X0
%Xmax = 0.1;
%Xmin = -0.1;
%Xumax = Xmax;
%Xumin = 0.05;
%X0max = Xumin-delta;
%X0min = Xmin;
%\end{lstlisting}

Then the symbolic state variables are declared for the SOS program in SOSTOOLS with the command \texttt{pvar}. % (which corresponds to the command \texttt{syms} in the MATLAB symbolic toolbox). 
Now the SOS program \texttt{prog} can be initialized using the function \texttt{sosprogram} which takes the state variable as input. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Declare state variables
pvar x1

% Initialize the sum of squares program
prog = sosprogram(x1);
\end{lstlisting}
%The reference for the robot position is generated as the 1D heart position, taking into account the system gain $\bar{N}$, and the closed-loop system equation is written as a function of the sybolic state. %\textcolor{red}{Something is wrong with the reference..?}
The vector field or derivative of the state can now be defined in terms on the symbolic state variable. This function is necessary for the SOS program when requiring that the Lie derivative of the barrier certificate must be negative on the set $\mathcal{X}$.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Vector field dx/dt = fx (closed loop)
fx = (A-B*K)*x1;
\end{lstlisting}
For ease of defining a (1D) function $g$ that is positive on an interval [$p_1, p_2$], a parabola function is used.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
function [a,b,c] = parabola(p1,p2,a)
	if ~exist('a','var')
		a=-1;
	end
	b=a*(p1^2-p2^2)/(p2-p1);
	c=-a*p1^2-b*p1;
end
\end{lstlisting}
Now declare the polynomial barrier function with the command \texttt{sospolyvar}. To do this, a monomial vector must be specified with \texttt{monomials} (see the monomial example in \autoref{eq:monomial_example}), which takes the state variable and the monomial degree(s) as input. The monomial degrees for $B(x)$ are chosen as low as possible until a solution can be found. In this case a solution can be found for a degree of $B(x)$ that is [0:4], i.e. a polynomial in $x_1$ of degrees zero through four.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Declare the polynomial barrier function
zB = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,Bar] = sospolyvar(prog,zB);
\end{lstlisting}
Now the set $\mathcal{X}$ can be defined as the slide region according to \autoref{fig:sos_slide} using the Lie derivative inequality in \autoref{cer3_putinar}, which is defined with the command \texttt{sosineq}. The SOS polynomials $q$ are of the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial}, i.e. $q=Z^TQZ$ (so the degree of $q$ is twice the degree of the monomial vector $Z$), and are declared with the command \texttt{sossosvar}, also taking a monomial vector as input.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Define space X in Rn
[a,b,c] = parabola(-0.1,0.1); % get coefficients for parabola which is positive for x in [-0.1,0.1] m
gX = a*x1^2+b*x1+c;

zX = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,qX] = sossosvar(prog,zX);

prog = sosineq(prog,-diff(Bar,x1)*fx-gX*qX);
\end{lstlisting}
Similarly, the unsafe region $\mathcal{X}_u$ is defined according to the SOS inequality in \autoref{cer2_putinar} as the area between slide positions 5-10\,cm as given by \autoref{fig:sos_slide}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Define space Xu in X
[a,b,c]=parabola(0.05,0.1);
gXu = a*x1^2+b*x1+c;

zXu = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,qXu] = sossosvar(prog,zXu);

prog = sosineq(prog,Bar-epsilon-gXu*qXu);
\end{lstlisting}
And finally the region $\mathcal{X}_0$ is defined according to the SOS inequality in \autoref{cer1_putinar} as $\mathcal{X}_0\subset\mathcal{X}\setminus\mathcal{X}_u$, separated from the unsafe set by the distance $\Delta$.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Define space X0 in X
[a,b,c]=parabola(-0.1,0.05-delta);
gX0 = a*x1^2+b*x1+c;

zX0 = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,qX0] = sossosvar(prog,zX0);

prog = sosineq(prog,-Bar-gX0*qX0);
\end{lstlisting}
With all three areas defined according to \autoref{def:barrier_sos}, the program is ready to be solved by using the command \texttt{sossolve}. If a solution is found, an overview of the solution accuracy is printed in the MATLAB terminal as the residual norm, feasibility ratio, number of iteration steps and solving time. To get the polynomial $B(x)$ use the function \texttt{sosgetsol}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Solve for barrier certificate
prog = sossolve(prog);
getB = sosgetsol(prog,Bar)
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{-2mm}
From the terminal printout it is verified that the problem is neiter primal or dual infeasible, and that the feasibility ratio for this solution is given as 1.0122, which is fairly close to 1 and hence indicates that the solution is valid. The solution is found in 15 iterations with a residual norm of 7.5521e-10 and thereby no indication of numerical errors.

To additionally verify that the solution is indeed valid, it is tested that the solution complies with the inequalities being \gls{sos} by testing if they can be resolved to the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Get coefficients for the remaining polynomials
getdBdx = diff(getB,x1)
getqXu1 = sosgetsol(prog,qXu);
getqX01 = sosgetsol(prog,qX0);
getqX1 = sosgetsol(prog,qX);

% Test if the inequalities are SOS
[Q,~,~] = findsos(getB-epsilon-gXu*getqXu1);
[Q2,~,~] = findsos(-getB-gX0*getqX01);
[Q3,~,~] = findsos(-detdBdx*fx-gX*getqX1);

\vspace{-5mm}
This is indeed the case, and it is thereby verified that a barrier certificate is found for the closed-loop system in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder}, namely
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}
B(x_1) = 373.0249\cdot x_1^4 + 151.3339\cdot x_1^3 + 16.8843\cdot x_1^2 - 6.4509e\text{-}6\cdot x_1 - 0.061301
\end{equation}

\vspace{-3mm}
The first three coefficients of the polynomial barrier certificate are of ample size (not in the order 1e-5 or less), while the fourth seem unimportant. Decreasing the degree of the monomial $Z_B$ (and thereby\,the\,order of $B$) to [0,2:4] %does, however, not prove a proper solution, as the inequality \autoref{cer3_putinar} cannot be resolved on the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial} and hence is not \gls{sos}. 
gives the solution
\begin{equation}
B(x_1) = 290.559\cdot x_1^4 + 112.4642\cdot x_1^3 + 12.2165\cdot x_1^2 - 0.044304
\end{equation}
which is also a valid barrier certificate, found in 13 iterations with feasibility ratio 0.9797 and a residual norm of 1.0412e-09.
The two barrier certificates are depicted in \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_noRef}, from which it is seen that  both comply with the requirements for a barrier certificate, i.e. they are positive ($B(x_1)\geq \bar{\epsilon}$) on $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x_1\in [0.05,0.1]\}$ and negative on $\mathcal{X}_0=\{x_1\in [-0.1,0.05-\Delta]\}$, and their Lie derivatives are nonpositive on $\mathcal{X}=\{x_1\in [-0.1,0.1]\}$, in accordance with \autoref{def:barrier_certificate}. It is also seen that the value of each of the barrier certificates on the set $\mathcal{X}$ seem reasonable being neither exceptionally small or large, verifying that the choice of $\bar{\epsilon}$ seems reasonable.

\end{figure}

It is noted that the safety verification is accomplished with a fourth order polynomial barrier certificate, while it can be argued that it could be possible with a second order polynomial. This is, however, not important for the safety verification of the system, where the conclusion is that a solution can be found, thus the system is safe.










\subsection{Verifying a Range of Reference Positions for the First Order System}\label{sec:sos_1storder_references}

Now a non-zero reference is introduced. As it is desired to verify safety for a whole range of references, the barrier polynomial is now formulated as a function of both position and reference $B(x,x_\text{ref})$.
The goal is to verify safety of the system in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} for a range of references, preferably for all references within the safe position interval, such that the sets would be as depicted in \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion}.
%However, from \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} it can be seen that with the unity gain matrix $\bar{\mathbf{N}}$ the system can be  written as
%\begin{equation}
%\dot{x} = \tau^{-1}(\mathbf{K}+1)(x_\text{ref}-x)\label{eq:1storder_christoffer}
%\end{equation}

It can be seen from \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} that the vector field will be zero when $x=x_\text{ref}$, which in turn means that the Lie derivative of the barrier function will be zero for $x=x_\text{ref}$, marked in \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_dBdx} with a green line. To the upper left of this line the system will have positive time derivative, thus requiring that the derivative of the barrier function with respect to $x_1$ must be negative in this region in order to comply with \autoref{cer3} i.e. $L_{f_{cl}}B(x) \leq 0$. To the lower right of the green line the system will have negative time derivative, thus analogously requiring that the derivative $dB/dx_1$ must be positive in this region.

Requiring a zero level set of the barrier certificate between $x_1=0.05-\Delta$ and $x_1=0.05$, this means that the value of $B(x)$ \textcolor{red}{something something}

%As this line crosses through the safe region, it means that it will be a minimum value of the barrier function of negative value. In \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_Bvalue} it can be seen that this minimum is very close to the zero level set around the unsafe region, requiring a very high degree polynomial to obtain this shape of zero level set. This can be resolved by decreasing the upper value of allowed references, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_Bvalue_limitref} with an example of a fairly smooth zero level set.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:sets_reference}
\end{figure}

The reference is introduced as another independent variable \texttt{xref} in the \gls{sos} program, and constraints for each of the sets are included as extra terms in the sums in \autoref{eq:barrier_constraints_putinar}, e.g. for the set $\mathcal{X}$ a new term with \gls{sos} polynomial $q(x)$ and polynomial $g(x_\text{ref})$, positive on the  reference  interval \texttt{[rMin,rMax]}, is included in the inequality as:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Constraint on the set X0 being nonpositive for the interval of references 
[a,b,c] = parabola(rMin,rMax); 
gX2 = a*xref^2+b*xref+c;

zX2 = monomials([x1,xref],0:4);
[prog,qX2] = sossosvar(prog,zX2);

prog = sosineq(prog,-[diff(Bar,x1) diff(Bar,xref)]*[fx;0] - gX1*qX1 - gX2*qX2);
\end{lstlisting}

A number of tests are run with SOSTOOLS for varying values of $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$, different degrees of the \gls{sos} polynomials $q_j$ (through their monomials) and the barrier certificate $B(x)$ itself, in order to understand the effect of varying each of these parameters and to test for which intervals of references a solution can be found.
A solution found with SOSTOOLS is considered valid if it passes the test that each of the expressions in the inequalities are \gls{sos} by testing if they can be resolved on the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial}. The analysis in the following is based on the results for these solutions, with the conclusions summarized in \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param}.

Numerical problems are reported for all solutions found, and the residual norms are in general in the order of -3 and -4, so it is desired to keep the degree of polynomials low and to increase the value of $\bar{\epsilon}$, compared to \autoref{subsec:zeroref}. As seen from \autoref{fig:sets_reference} $\bar{\epsilon}$ is the minimum value of the barrier function on the unsafe set, and increasing this may require the zero level set to be pushed further away from $\mathcal{X}_u$. This may in turn require also increasing the distance $\Delta$ to the safe set, i.e. contracting the region $\mathcal{X}_0$.
%It makes sense that increasing epsilon will also require a slight increase in delta from the figure, as the zero level set of B has to be between the two sets i.e. decreasing the region X0.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
\rowcolor{HeaderBlue}
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Effect of variation}\\
deg$(B)$ & In general the feasibility ratio is better (closer to one) when testing for higher degrees of $B(x)$ ([0:6] or [0:8] compared to [0:4]), and solutions can be found for larger intervals of the reference when $B(x)$ has higher degree.\\
\rowcolor{textBlue}
deg$(q_j)$ & Increasing the degree of the \gls{sos} polynomials ([0:6] compared to [0:2] or [0:4]) generally degrades the feasibility ratio.\\
$\bar{\epsilon}$ & Increasing $\bar{\epsilon}$ decreases the allowed reference interval and also shows a trend of slightly increasing the residual norm. Increasing $\bar{\epsilon}$ iteratively proves that gradually an increase in $\Delta$ is also required for solutions to be found. \\
\rowcolor{textBlue}
$\Delta$ & Generally increasing $\Delta$ will also decrease the allowed interval of references, and shows a trend of decreasing the residual norm until some limit.\\
\textbf{K} & Lowering the gain of the controller increases  the allowed reference interval.
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Effect of varying different parameters in the \gls{sos} program; see \autoref{fig:sets_reference} for a visualization of $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$. Results are only included for solutions where all inequalities were verified to be \gls{sos}.}
\label{tab:sostools_varying_param}

Point of departure is taken in the same values for the parameters $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$, and degrees of the \gls{sos} polynomials $q_j$ and the barrier certificate as presented in \autoref{subsec:zeroref}, i.e. $\bar{\epsilon}=0.001$, $\Delta=0.001$, deg$(B)=$[0:4] and all \gls{sos} polynomials deg$(q_j)=$[0:4]. The same controller gain is used as described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder} ($\textbf{K}=9$), and a small interval of references around zero is used initially.

The interval of references for which a solution can be found depends on all of the parameters summarized in \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param}. The lower limit of allowed references in $\mathcal{X}_0$ is independent of the parameters, though,  as no irrealizable requirements are set for $B(x)$ in this region. Hence it is the upper  end of the interval which is tested to which limit it can be elevated.




Larger intervals of allowed references are found the smaller $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$ are and increasing the degree of $B(x)$ from [0:4] to [0:6] elevates the upper limit for allowed references, as seen from \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k9_B4_q4} and \ref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k9_B6_q4} where the reference interval for which a solution can be found is increased from an upper limit of 1.2\,cm to 2\,cm. This obviously comes at the cost of a somewhat more lengthy polynomial expression, the fourth order polynomial given as (decimals are left out for clarity)

%Generally increasing $\Delta$ will also decrease the allowed interval and shows a trend of decreasing the residual norm until some limit where it doesn't seem to affect the construction of B so much more.

\label{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k9_B6_q4}

As it can be seen from \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k9_B4_q4} and \ref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k9_B6_q4}, increasing the order of the barrier polynomial indeed does have an effect on the steepness of the curve.
The asterisks in each of the plots of $L_{f_{cl}}B(x)$ marks spots on the curve where its value is positive, which in all cases happen along the line $x_1=x_\text{ref}$. The reason for this error is the numerical problems encountered for all of the solutions.

It is known from the implementation described in \autoref{sec:davinci-implementation}, that at present time the controller gain that can be implemented is considerably lower than the gain of $\mathbf{K}=9$, and hence safety is sought to be certified for a greater interval of references by using a lower gain. \Autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k02_B6_q2} shows a plot of another sixth order polynomial barrier certificate found for a system with feedback gain $\mathbf{K}=0.2$, which is valid for references in an interval extending up to 3.2\,cm.

\vspace{5mm}

To deal with the fact that the identified barrier certificates suffer from residual errors only one order of magnitude smaller than the value of $\bar{\epsilon}$, this value is increased to seek a numerically better certificate. In \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k02_B6_q2_e01} a sixth order barrier polynomial is found for an increased $\bar{\epsilon}=0.1$, however, now a solution can only be found for a smaller interval of allowed references of up to 1.7\,cm.

In \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k02_B6_q4_e1} the value is increased even more, $\bar{\epsilon}=1$, yet again causing that a solution can be found only for a smaller range of references, thus arriving at a verification of a safe system for an interval of allowed references of -10\,cm  to 1.6\,cm. Notice how the two sets of  curves in  \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k02_B6_q4_e1} appear to be an up-scaled version of the ones in \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_withRef_k02_B6_q2_e01}, caused by the required value $\bar{\epsilon}$ of the barrier function on the unsafe set being ten times greater.

\subsection{Considering the Error as the Independent Variable}\label{sec:sos_1storder_error}

As it is seen from \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param} there are quite a few tuning parameters when searching for a barrier certificate, and iteratively finding a combination giving as large an interval of allowed references within $\mathcal{X}_0$ as possible can be a long process. %Recall the system:
%\begin{flalign*}
%\dot{x} = \underbrace{(\textbf{A} - \textbf{B}\textbf{K})}_{-\tau^{-1}(\textbf{K}+1)} x + \underbrace{\textbf{B}\bar{\textbf{N}}}_{\tau^{-1}(\textbf{K}+1)} x_\text{ref} \kk \Leftrightarrow \kk \dot{x} = \tau^{-1}(\textbf{K}+1)\underbrace{(x_\text{ref} - x)}_{x_\text{err}}
%\end{flalign*}
Hence instead of formulating the barrier certificate in terms of the robot position and the position reference as in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder}, the problem can be reduced to one dimension  through a coordinate shift to the error state as seen in \autoref{fig:sos_error_2d}, the error being: % it can plainly be formulated as the error between the two:
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{equation*}
x_\text{err}=x_\text{ref}-x
\end{equation*}

\vspace{-5mm}
giving the error dynamics
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{align}
\dot{x}_\text{err} = -\dot{x} &= -\tau^{-1}(\mathbf{K}+1)(x_\text{ref}-x) \nonumber\\
&= -\tau^{-1}(\mathbf{K}+1)x_\text{err}
\end{align}

\vspace{-2mm}
Now safety can  be tested for relative positions instead of absolute. 
%It is still assumed that any reference given is given outside the unsafe area, which according to \autoref{tab:intervals} is the absolute slide positions $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x_1\in[0.05,0.1]\}$, and it is still the goal to determine how close to the unsafe set references can be given while still guaranteeing safety.
%The error will be negative when the end effector is above the reference, and 
As seen from \autoref{fig:sos_slide}, the unsafe region is the upper part of the interval $\mathcal{X}$, which means that for references given outside the unsafe set, unsafety of the system will only occur if the robot end-effector position is above the reference, corresponding to a negative error. This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_delta_error}.
Hence it is required to restrict the error in the negative direction to some value -$\delta_\text{err}$, thus restricting the upper value of allowed (safe) references to a distance $\delta_\text{err}$ from the unsafe region, as sketched in \autoref{fig:sos_errorref_1d_new}. %corresponding to restricting how much the end effector position is allowed to be above (more positive than) the reference. 

%If a reference is given at a distance $\delta_\text{err}$ from the unsafe region starting at 5\,cm, it is required that the error does not exceed $-\delta_\text{err}$ in the negative direction. This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_error_2d}. Thus testing how large an interval of allowed references can be given with guaranteed system safety, corresponds to testing how small an (absolute) value of $-\delta_\text{err}$ outlining the unsafe region of the error state system, for which safety can be guaranteed. This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_error_1d}.



\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\subbottom[]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{sos_error_2d.pdf}\label{fig:sos_error_2d}}%

\caption{With references given outside the unsafe region, system safety can be guaranteed if the error is certified to stay above the value -$\delta_\text{err}$. When this is the case, system safety is guaranteed for all references up to a safety distance of $\delta_\text{err}$ from the unsafe set.}
	\label{fig:sets_error}
\end{figure}

When restricting the error to a lower limit -$\delta_\text{err}$, this restriction corresponds to not allowing the end-effector position more than the distance $\delta_\text{err}$ above the reference anywhere outside the unsafe region. However, if a barrier certificate can be found for the error state system with unsafe set being values below -$\delta_\text{err}$, this means that safety of the system in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} can be guaranteed for references up to  the distance $\delta_\text{err}$ from the unsafe region.

%this is in principle done for any reference, thus if a reference is given far away from the unsafe area, the end effector is still not allowed to be more than the small distance $\delta_\text{err}$ above the reference. 

%In the error space this means that the error must not go below $-\delta_\text{err}$. If a barrier certificate can be found for unsafe errors of $-\delta_\text{err}$ and below ($\mathcal{X}_u=\{x_\text{err}\in [-??,-\delta_\text{err}]\}$), it can be guaranteed that the robot position will never be more than a distance $\delta_\text{err}$ above the reference, and hence it is verified that references can be given as long as the reference is at least a distance $\delta_\text{err}$ from the unsafe set.

The system equation in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} is valid for small steps of approximately 5\,mm, thus the set to be considered in the error state space is chosen to $\pm 3$\,cm. This gives the set definitions for the error state system:
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.7mm
\item The set considered is well over the usual reference step size of approximately 5\,mm, $\mathcal{X}=\{x_\text{err}\in[-0.03,0.03] \}$.
\item The unsafe set includes values below -$\delta_\text{err}$, $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x_\text{err}\in [-0.03,-\delta_\text{err}] \}$.
\item The safe set is a distance $\Delta$ from the unsafe set, where $\Delta<\delta_\text{err}$ such that the safe set will include $x_\text{err}=0$, $\mathcal{X}_0=\{x_\text{err}\in [-\delta_\text{err}+\Delta,0.03] \}$
\end{itemize}

%Due to the underlying low-level controllers in the system (see \autoref{fig:overview}), the system equation in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} is only valid for small steps of less than 3\,cm. Therefore the tests on the error state system in SOSTOOLS are made on a set $\mathcal{X}=\{x_\text{err}\in[-0.03,0.03] \}$, thus testing for how small a value $\delta_\text{err}$ for which a solution can be found when the unsafe set is $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x_\text{err}\in[-0.03,-\delta_\text{err}] \}$, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_errorref_1d}. 
A valid solution will certify that steps in positive direction (upwards) of 3\,cm is acceptable, and will never yield an error below $-\delta_\text{err}$, and that references can safely be given that have a distance of at least $\delta_\text{err}$ to the unsafe positions, hence certifying safety of the system: %i.e. safe references are references below 5\,cm $-\delta_\text{err}$. For references below the end effector position no barrier certificate is needed, although the certificate found does allow steps in downwards direction of up to $\delta_\text{err}$. \textcolor{red}{Er ikke sikker p\aa  det giver mening med stepst\o rrelser, er det steady-state fejlen vi ser p\aa ?}
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.7mm
	\item The set considered is the set described in \autoref{fig:sos_slide}, $\mathcal{X}=\{x\in[-0.1,0.1] \}$.
	\item The unsafe set is also seen in \autoref{fig:sos_slide}, $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x\in [0.05,0.1] \}$.
	\item The safe set for the references is $\mathcal{X}_0=\{x_\text{ref}\in [-0.1,0.05-\delta_\text{err}] \}$ ensuring that $\mathcal{X}_0\subseteq\mathcal{X}\setminus\mathcal{X}_u$.
\end{itemize}

Again the parameters given in \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param} are tweaked to find the smallest possible value of $\delta_\text{err}$ yielding a valid solution, the findings conforming with the previous conclusions, the additional conclusions listed in \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param_error}.

%systemet har underliggende controllere der gør at systemmodellen kun gælder hvis der gives små steps i reference, derfor er der ingen grund til at define et rum X i errorspace der er større til hver side end de step der kan gives


Running a number of tests in SOSTOOLS varying the parameters in \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param_error} it is concluded that solutions for $\delta_\text{err}<9$\,mm cannot be found, and hence safety can be guaranteed if references are given at a minimum distance of 9\,mm from the unsafe region. \textcolor{green}{for f\o rste ordens system er det underligt den ikke kan g\aa\, helt ud til kanten, der burde ikke v\ae re oversving, hvad kan \aa rsagen v\ae re?}

Examples of results are given in the figures in the following pages. Comparing the plots in \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_error_k9_varying_degrees} it is seen that increasing the degree of the barrier certificate from four to six does not change the curve much on the interval $\mathcal{X}$, while it does lower the residual norm an order. It can also be seen that increasing the degree of the \gls{sos} polynomials from two to four also hardly changes the curve, but increases the residual norm two orders. Finally, comparing the plots in  \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_error_k02_B6_q4_varying_epsilon} it is clearly seen that requiring a ten times larger value  $\bar{\epsilon}$ on the unsafe set, the barrier certificate is scaled up approximately ten times in value. As indicated, though, the residual norm is also increased along with $\bar{\epsilon}$.

Maybe a corresponding positive value can be found restricting the error in the positive direction hence also restricting how much the end effector position is allowed to be below any reference \textcolor{red}{NOT TESTED}. If a barrier certificate for the error can be found ensuring that the error will stay within the interval $[-\delta_\text{err},\delta_\text{err}]$ i.e. with unsafe regions on both sides of this interval, this means that for any reference, the end effector position can be guaranteed never to be more than a distance $\delta_\text{err}$ away from the reference \textcolor{red}{in steady-state? It cannot say anything about steps that are larger than $\delta_\text{err}$, but maybe we don't care about that?}
