\section{Barrier Certificate Search for First Order 1D System}
A barrier certificate search is tested on the first order system as described in \autoref{subsec:model_1d}, i.e. for the  1D state space system with $x_1\in\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}$ corresponding to the robot slide joint being the only degree of freedom (see \autoref{fig:safe:overview} for an overview of the slide movement), with a linear position controller as described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder}, thus a closed-loop system
\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = \textbf{A}x+\textbf{B}u = \textbf{A}x+\textbf{B}(\bar{\mathbf{N}}x_\text{ref}-\textbf{K}x) = %-\tau^{-1}x+\tau^{-1}u=
-\tau^{-1}x+\tau^{-1}(\bar{\mathbf{N}}x_\text{ref}-\textbf{K}x), \kk \text{with }\tau=110\,\text{ms}\label{eq:sos_firstorder}
\end{equation}
This system is used in the following subsections in the barrier function search.

\subsection{First Order System with Zero Reference}\label{subsec:zeroref}
To give a clear picture of the structure of the \gls{sos} program, an initial exhaustive example is given for the simple 1D first order system with zero as reference position.
Define the open-loop system, and design a controller (with pole placement) as described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Time constant from measurement
tau = 0.11;
% State-space matrices from first order open-loop system
A = -1/tau;
B = 1/tau;
% Setpoint controller that is xx times faster than the system
xx = 10;
K = place(A,B,[xx*A]);
\end{lstlisting}
Define the desired distance $\Delta$ between the safe and unsafe sets,  the minimum value $\bar{\epsilon}$ of the barrier function on the unsafe set, and the boundaries for each of the three sets $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{X}_u$ and $\mathcal{X}_0$. %in order to get $\mathcal{X} =\{x\in[-0.1,0.1]\}$, $\mathcal{X}_u=\{x\in[0.05,0.1]\}$ and $\mathcal{X}_0=\{x\in[-0.1,0.05-\Delta]\}$.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% scaling factor = 1/100 for [meter], or 1 for [cm]
scale = 1/100;

% Distance between defined safe and unsafe regions
delta = 0.1*scale;

% Minimum value of the barrier certificate on the unsafe set Xu
epsilon = 0.001;

% Set upper and lower limits for the set intervals X, Xu and X0
Xmax = 10*scale;
Xmin = -10*scale;
Xumax = Xmax;
Xumin = 5*scale;
X0max = Xumin-delta;
X0min = Xmin;
\end{lstlisting}

Then the symbolic state variables are declared for the SOS program in SOSTOOLS with the command \texttt{pvar} (which corresponds to the command \texttt{syms} in the MATLAB symbolic toolbox). Now the SOS program \texttt{prog} can be initialized using the function \texttt{sosprogram} which takes the state variable(s) as input. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Declare state variables
pvar x1

% Initialize the sum of squares program
prog = sosprogram(x1);
\end{lstlisting}
%The reference for the robot position is generated as the 1D heart position, taking into account the system gain $\bar{N}$, and the closed-loop system equation is written as a function of the sybolic state. %\textcolor{red}{Something is wrong with the reference..?}
The vector field or derivative of the state can now be defined in terms on the symbolic state variable. This function is necessary for the SOS program when requiring that the Lie derivative of the barrier certificate must be negative on the set $\mathcal{X}$.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Vector field dx/dt = fx (closed loop)
fx = (A-B*K)*x1;
\end{lstlisting}
For ease of defining a (1D) function $g$ that is positive on an interval [$p_1, p_2$], a parabola function is used.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
function [a,b,c] = parabola(p1,p2,a)
	if ~exist('a','var')
		a=-1;
	end
	b=a*(p1^2-p2^2)/(p2-p1);
	c=-a*p1^2-b*p1;
end
\end{lstlisting}
Now declare the polynomial barrier function with the command \texttt{sospolyvar}. To do this, a monomial vector must be specified with \texttt{monomials} (see the monomial example in \autoref{eq:monomial_example}), which takes as input the state variable(s) and the monomial degree(s). The monomial degrees for $B(x)$ are chosen as low as possible until a solution can be found. In this case a solution can be found for a degree of $B(x)$ that is 0:4.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Declare the polynomial barrier function
zB = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,Bar] = sospolyvar(prog,zB);
\end{lstlisting}
Now the region $\mathcal{X}$ can be defined for the slide region $\pm0.1$\,m using the Lie derivative inequality in \autoref{cer3_putinar}, which is defined with the command \texttt{sosineq}. The SOS polynomials $q$ are of the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial}, i.e. $q=Z^TQZ$ (so the degree of $q$ is twice the degree of the monomial vector $Z$), and are declared with the command \texttt{sossosvar}, also taking a monomial vector as input.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Define space X in Rn
[a,b,c] = parabola(Xmin,Xmax); % get coefficients for parabola which is positive for x in [-0.1,0.1] m
gX = a*x1^2+b*x1+c;

zX = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,qX] = sossosvar(prog,zX);

prog = sosineq(prog,-diff(Bar,x1)*fx-gX*qX);
\end{lstlisting}
Similarly, the region $\mathcal{X}_u$ is defined according to the SOS inequality in \autoref{cer2_putinar} as the area between slide positions 5-10\,cm.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Define space Xu in X
[a,b,c]=parabola(Xumin,Xumax);
gXu = a*x1^2+b*x1+c;

zXu = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,qXu] = sossosvar(prog,zXu);

prog = sosineq(prog,Bar-epsilon-gXu*qXu);
\end{lstlisting}
And finally the region $\mathcal{X}_0$ is defined according to the SOS inequality in \autoref{cer1_putinar} as $\mathcal{X}_0\subset\mathcal{X}\setminus\mathcal{X}_u$, separated from the unsafe set by the distance $\Delta$.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Define space X0 in X
[a,b,c]=parabola(X0min,X0max);
gX0 = a*x1^2+b*x1+c;

zX0 = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,qX0] = sossosvar(prog,zX0);

prog = sosineq(prog,-Bar-gX0*qX0);
\end{lstlisting}
With all three areas defined according to \autoref{eq:barrier_constraints_putinar}, the program is ready to be solved by using the command \texttt{sossolve}. If a solution is found, an overview of the solution accuracy is printed in the MATLAB terminal as the residual norm, number of iteration steps and solving time. To get the polynomial $B(x)$ use the function \texttt{sosgetsol}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Solve for barrier certificate
prog = sossolve(prog);
getB = sosgetsol(prog,Bar)
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{-2mm}
From the terminal printout it is verified that the problem is neiter primal or dual infeasible, and that the feasibility ratio for this solution is given as 1.0122, which is fairly close to 1 and hence indicates that the solution is valid. The solution is found in 15 iterations with a residual norm of 7.5521e-10 and no indication of numerical errors.

To additionally verify that the solution is indeed valid, it is tested that the solution complies with the inequalities being \gls{sos} by testing if they can be resolved to the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Get coefficients for the remaining polynomials
getdBdx = diff(getB,x1)
getqXu1 = sosgetsol(prog,qXu);
getqX01 = sosgetsol(prog,qX0);
getqX1 = sosgetsol(prog,qX);

% Test if the inequalities are SOS
[Q,~,~] = findsos(getB-epsilon-gXu*getqXu1);
[Q2,~,~] = findsos(-getB-gX0*getqX01);
[Q3,~,~] = findsos(-diff(getB,x1)*fx-gX*getqX1);

\vspace{-2mm}
This is indeed the case, and it is thereby verified that a barrier certificate is found for the closed-loop system in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder}, namely
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}
B(x_1) = 373.0249\cdot x_1^4 + 151.3339\cdot x_1^3 + 16.8843\cdot x_1^2 - 6.4509e\text{-}6\cdot x_1 - 0.061301
\end{equation}

\vspace{-3mm}
The first three coefficients of the polynomial barrier certificate are of ample size (not in the order 1e-5 or less), while the last seem unimportant. Decreasing the degree of the monomial $Z_B$ (and thereby\,the\,order of $B$) to [2:4] does, however, not prove a proper solution, as the inequality \autoref{cer3_putinar} cannot be resolved on the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial} and hence is not \gls{sos}. The  barrier certificate is depicted in \autoref{fig:1D_1stordersys_noRef}.

\subsection{Verifying a Range of Reference Positions for the First Order System}

Now a non-zero reference is introduced. As it is desired to verify a whole range of references, the barrier polynomial is now formulated as a function of both state and reference $B(x,x_\text{ref})$.
The goal is to verify the system in \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} for a range of references, preferably for all references within the safe position interval, such that the sets would be as depicted in \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion}.
However, from \autoref{eq:sos_firstorder} it can be seen that with the unity gain matrix $\bar{\mathbf{N}}$ the system can be  written as
\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = \tau^{-1}(\mathbf{K}+1)(x_\text{ref}-x)\label{eq:1storder_christoffer}
\end{equation}
which will be zero when $x=x_\text{ref}$. This means that the Lie derivative will be zero for $x=x_\text{ref}$, and as this line is part of the safe region, it means that it will be a minimum value of the barrier function of negative value. In \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_Bvalue} it can be seen that this minimum is very close to the zero level set around the unsafe region, requiring a very high degree polynomial to obtain this shape of zero level set. This can be resolved by decreasing the upper value of allowed references, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_Bvalue_limitref} with an example of a fairly smooth zero level set.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Outline of the safe and unsafe sets marking the value requirements for the barrier certificate as a function of the robot position and the reference position. \Autoref{fig:sos_Xregion} depicts a set $\mathcal{X}$ where all references within the safe positions are allowed. \Autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_Bvalue} sketches that $B(x)$ will have a minimum in $x=x_\text{ref}$ as inferred from \autoref{eq:1storder_christoffer} and \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_Bvalue_limitref} shows how an insoluble requirement for obtaining the zero level set may be relaxed by contracting the interval of allowed references.}
\label{fig:sets_reference}
\end{figure}

The reference is introduced as another independent variable \texttt{xref} in the \gls{sos} program, and constraints for each of the sets are included as extra terms in the sums in \autoref{eq:barrier_constraints_putinar}, e.g. for the set $\mathcal{X}_0$ a new term with \gls{sos} polynomial $q(x)$ and polynomial $g(x_\text{ref})$ positive on a reference (test) interval is included in the inequality as:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Constraint on the set X0 being nonpositive for the interval of references 
[a,b,c]=parabola(rMin,rMax);
gX02 = a*xref^2+b*xref+c;
zX02 = monomials(xtilde,0:4);
[prog,qX02] = sossosvar(prog,zX02);

prog = sosineq(prog,-B-gX01*qX01-gX02*qX02);
\end{lstlisting}

A number of tests are run with SOSTOOLS for varying values of $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$, different degrees of the \gls{sos} polynomials $q_j$ (through their monomials) and the barrier certificate $B(x)$ itself, in order to understand the effect of varying each of these parameters and to test for which intervals of references a solution can be found.
A solution found with SOSTOOLS is considered valid if it passes the test that each of the expressions in the inequalities are \gls{sos} by testing if they can be resolved on the form in \autoref{eq:sos_polynomial}. The analysis in the following is based on the results for these solutions, with the conclusions summarized in \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param}.

Numerical problems are reported for all solutions found, and the residual norms are in general in the order of -3 and -4, so it is desired to keep the degree of polynomials low and to increase the value of $\bar{\epsilon}$, compared to \autoref{subsec:zeroref}. As seen from \autoref{fig:sos_Xregion_Bvalue} $\bar{\epsilon}$ is the minimum value of the barrier function on the unsafe set, and increasing this may require the zero level set to be pushed further away from $\mathcal{X}_u$. This may require also increasing the distance $\Delta$ to the safe set, i.e. contracting the region $\mathcal{X}_0$.
%It makes sense that increasing epsilon will also require a slight increase in delta from the figure, as the zero level set of B has to be between the two sets i.e. decreasing the region X0.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
\rowcolor{HeaderBlue}
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Effect of variation}\\
deg$(B)$ & In general the feasibility ratio is better (closer to one) when testing for higher degrees of $B(x)$ (0:6 or 0:8 compared to 0:4), and solutions can be found for larger intervals of the reference when $B(x)$ has higher degree.\\
\rowcolor{textBlue}
deg$(q_j)$ & Increasing the degree of the \gls{sos} polynomials (0:6 compared to 0:2 or 0:4) generally degrades the feasibility ratio.\\
$\bar{\epsilon}$ & Increasing $\bar{\epsilon}$ shows a trend of slightly increasing the residual norm. Increasing $\bar{\epsilon}$ iteratively proves that gradually an increase in $\Delta$ is also required for solutions to be found. \\
\rowcolor{textBlue}
$\Delta$ & Generally increasing $\Delta$ will also decrease the allowed interval of references, and shows a trend of decreasing the residual norm until some limit.\\
\textbf{K} & Lowering the gain of the controller increases  the allowed reference interval.
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Effect of varying different parameters in the \gls{sos} program, see \autoref{fig:sets_reference} for a visualization of $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$. Results are only included for solutions where all inequalities were verified to be \gls{sos}.}
\label{tab:sostools_varying_param}
\end{table}


Point of departure is taken in the same values for the parameters $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$, and degrees of the \gls{sos} polynomials $q_j$ and the barrier certificate as presented in \autoref{subsec:zeroref}, i.e. $\bar{\epsilon}=0.001$, $\Delta=0.001$, deg$(B)=$[0:4] and all \gls{sos} polynomials deg$(q_j)=$[0:4]. The same controller gain is used as described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder} ($\textbf{K}=9$), and a small interval of references around zero is used initially.

The interval of references for which a solution can be found depends on all of the parameters summarized in \autoref{tab:sostools_varying_param}. The lower limit of allowed references in $\mathcal{X}_0$ is independent of the parameters, though,  as no irrealizable requirements are set for $B(x)$ in this region. Hence it is the upper  end of the interval which is tested to which limit it can be elevated.




Larger intervals of allowed references are found the smaller $\bar{\epsilon}$ and $\Delta$ are and increasing the degree of $B(x)$ from [0:4] to [0:6] elevates the upper limit for allowed references.



%Generally increasing $\Delta$ will also decrease the allowed interval and shows a trend of decreasing the residual norm until some limit where it doesn't seem to affect the construction of B so much more.

%B degree 0:6 -- ok in interval +-1cm, feas ratio 0.9657, numerr 0, resnorm 6.7e-6. expanding downwards, for -3cm feas ratio 0.8727, to -4cm feasratio 0.9342, for -5 feasratio 0.9321, for -6cm feasratio 0.9579, -10, 1.5cm feasr 0.8377, not workin to 2cm, because the Q not working is that for Xu try to increase $\bar{\epsilon}$ and because numerr is 1 (not workin) also increasing $\Delta$ (also not working). Back to $\bar{\epsilon}=0.001$, $\Delta=0.001$. ok with 1.7cm feasr 0.8259 numerr 0 resnorm 0.00064404, works with 2cm feasr 0.6538 numerr 0 resnorm 0.00087217, not working with 2.5cm (or back down to 2.1cm) ---------- increase $\bar{\epsilon}=1$, $\Delta=0.01$ does not work at max -5cm, increase $\Delta=0.02$ works for max -5cm but not for -1cm (and still not working if decreasing $\bar{\epsilon}=0.1$), works for $\bar{\epsilon}=0.01$ feasr 0.9505 numerr 1 resnorm 8.2627e-5, this also works for rmax 1cm feasr 0.9486 numerr 1 resnorm 0.00056789, but not working at 2cm (and still not when decreasing $\Delta=0.01$ or to $\Delta=0.001$)

%B degree 0:4 -- interval -6, 1cm feas ratio 0.8694, to -7cm feasr 0.9270, -8cm feasr 0.8763 resnorm 0.00027269, -9cm feasr 0.8763, -10cm feasr 0.8255 resnorm 0.00068869, not working with -10, 2cm or with -10,1.5cm, but works with 1.2cm feasr 0.7455 numerr 0 resnorm 0.00060655 "run into numerical problems" (increasing qs to 0:6 still not working with 1.3cm), increasing $\bar{\epsilon}=0.01$ because of numerical problems and resnorm but not working with 1.2cm (also not working when increasing $\Delta=0.01$), but with this delta it works at 0.5cm feasr 0.9030 numerr 1 resnorm 0.0003211, then decreasing delta back not working
%
%try to increase the degree of B and qs drastically, but feasratio becomes negative and Q1 cannot be found (it also takes very long to compute), primal infeasible. Decreasing degrees to B 0:8 and qs 0:6 and $\bar{\epsilon}=0.001$, $\Delta=0.001$ solution found for -10,1.5cm feasr 0.8754, however decreasing degree of qs to 0:4 increases feasr to 0.9458, lowering B to 0:6 feasr 0.8865
