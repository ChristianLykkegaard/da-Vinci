%One outcome of the Marginal Zone Law is that a larger part of Danish land will become wetlands, which is known to have a higher emission of methane than other types of land.

%%The Marginal Zone Law was on September 1$^\text{st}$ 2012 incorporated as part the Danish environmental legislation. This law imposes upon farmers that a greater amount of land around streams and lakes must be uncultivated. This, in turn, entails that a greater part of Danish land is transformed into wetlands, which is known to have a higher emission of methane than other types of land. 
%As this emission is rated as part of the CO$_2$-quotas, biologists wish to obtain a more thorough estimate of the emission and to do so at a lower cost than what is possible at present.
%Biologists are requesting a type of vehicle that autonomously navigates around wetlands and take measurements of methane concentrations in a way that enables the biologists to map the methane emission of an area, and to do so at a low cost.
Biologists are requesting a type of vehicle that autonomously navigates around wetlands and take measurements of methane concentrations. This enables the biologists to map the methane emission of an area at a low cost.

The type of vehicle suited for such an operation is analysed along with navigational methods in order to follow a predefined route and to avoid unforeseen obstacles.

Models of the vehicle are developed and on basis of these, a real-time controller system is developed around an Arduino platform. It takes sensor inputs on position, orientation, velocity, hindrances as well as methane concentration. The solution is partly hardware, partly computations carried out in pseudo-parallel by an open source kernel. Additionally a wireless communication system is implemented in order for the user to be able to instruct a route and to retrieve measurement data.

The vehicle is verified to work as intended, i.e. completing a methane survey with a precision of 3\,m from any waypoint uploaded through a user interface at a constant speed of 1.5\,km/h in order to optimize the battery consumption and simultaneously avoid critical obstacles.

%Personer med nedsat synsevne har i mange tilfælde svært ved at navigere, og kan derfor benytte forskellige navigationshjælpemidler. På baggrund af en analyse, der kortlægger nødvendigheden af hjælp samt en undersøgelse af løsningsmodeller, udvikles et navigationshjælpemiddel der vha. ultralydspulser, tilknyttet en beamformingsalgoritme, giver taktil feedback i tre retninger fra tre vibratorer.

%Grundlæggende problemer i designparadigmet efterlader et system, der under ideelle forhold skelner mellem 24 målepunkter indenfor en vinkel på 40, men i praksis ikke kan retningsbestemme entydigt. Afstandsmåling differentieres i fire kategorier op til 4 m, hvilket fungerer i både det ideelle miljø og praksis.
