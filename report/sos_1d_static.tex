In this and the following chapters, barrier certificates are attempted to be constructed by use of Putinar's Positivstellensatz in \autoref{def:putinar} with the Matlab toolbox SOSTOOLS (see \autoref{app:sostools} for a short introduction to the toolbox). In this chapter the first and second order systems depicted in \autoref{fig:stepresponseslide} are considered with a static reference on the position.




\section{Safety Verification of First Order System}
First a linear open-loop state space system is defined according to the measurement of a step on the robot slide, showing a time constant $\tau=110$\,ms, giving the closed-loop system in \autoref{eq:1storder_1D_ss}:
\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = Ax+Bu = Ax+B(\bar{N}x_{ref}-Kx) = %-\tau^{-1}x+\tau^{-1}u=
-\tau^{-1}x+\tau^{-1}(\bar{N}x_{ref}-Kx)
\label{eq:1D_1storder}
\end{equation} 
which can be recast as the augmented state-space system
\begin{equation}
\dot{\tilde{x}}=
\dot{\begin{bmatrix}
	x_1\\x_{ref}
	\end{bmatrix}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
A-BK&B\bar{N}\\0&0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1\\x_{ref}
\end{bmatrix}
= f_{cl}(x)
\label{eq:xtilde_1storder_1D}
\end{equation}
with no dynamics on the reference. A controller $K$ is found according to pole placement as described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder}, i.e. for the first order 1D system in \autoref{eq:1D_1storder} a controller that is 10 times faster than the system will be $K=9$. Similarly the system scaling factor $\bar{N}$ is determined according to the method described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder} as $\bar{N}=10$.
The independent state variables are defined and the SOS program initialized as described in \autoref{sec:app_sostools_barrier_search}.

%Now the $g_j$ functions in \autoref{eq:barrier_constraints_putinar} are constructed according to \autoref{fig:safe:overview}:
%\begin{itemize}
%%\itemsep-1.3mm
%\itemsep-0.7mm
%\item The set $\mathcal{X}$ is defined by constructing a (second order polynomial) function $g_{1}(x_1)\geq 0 \in [\Lambda_{\text{lim}-},\Lambda_{\text{lim}+}]= [-0.1,0.1]$\,m, delimiting the region of possible robot tool positions, and another function $g_2(x_{ref})\geq 0 \in [\Lambda_{h-}+\Delta,\Lambda_{h+}-\Delta]=[-0.1+\Delta,0.05-\Delta]$\,m, delimiting the region of allowable reference positions 
%\end{itemize}

The linear first order system from \autoref{eq:1storder_1D_ss} is defined with the same pole placement controller and thereby system gain as in \autoref{eq:K_1} and \ref{eq:barm_1}, and the same regions/intervals assigned for $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{X}_u$ and $\mathcal{X}_0$ as given in \autoref{fig:safe:overview} - see \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos}.

The interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$ is the interval of positions from which a reference can be taken $x_{ref}\in\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta}$. This interval is slightly smaller than the safe initial set $\mathcal{X}_0$, separated from the zero level set of $B(x)$ by the small distance $\Delta$.}
\label{fig:intervals_for_sos}
\end{figure}

The small $\epsilon>0$ from \autoref{cer2_putinar} is defined "as small as possible", and another small $\Delta>0$ is introduced in order to be test for validity of a controller with references within the interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$ with a distance of at least $\Delta$ to the zero level set of $B(x)$, see \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos}.

\end{lstlisting}
The polynomial $B(x)$ is declared in as small degree "as possible". If any odd-order functions $g_j$ exist, $B(x)$'s leading term should be of an even degree higher than the uneven degree of the leading term of that $g_jq_j$. \textcolor{red}{It is considered that $B(x)$ should only be a function of the position and not of the reference, as the controller is considered as a static position setpoint controller for one single reference, and the program then tests the set of controllers, each with a setpoint within the interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$, for safety.}

As $B(x)$ should be valid for the set $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{X}$ is defined by $g_1(x_1)$ being positive on the slide interval, \textcolor{red}{and simultaneously $g_2(x_{ref})$ being positive on the interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$.} See \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos} and \ref{fig:1D_static_gfunctions}.

In the definition of the set $\mathcal{X}$, corresponding to the space where the barrier certificate is valid, also a function $g$ of the reference/setpoint is used. This means that the barrier certificate is valid for all controllers with setpoint within the interval where $g(x_{ref})$ is positive.}

In most cases the solution found has a leading term coefficient of order between -4 and -2, but very often the value of $B(x)$ is either positive or negative on the entire interval [-0.1,0.1]. \textcolor{red}{Strangely, in all tested combinations, $L_{f_{cl}}B(x)$ is positive-valued on an interval approximately [-0.02,0]. This and the fact that the zero level set of the barrier in no case is in $x=0.05$ makes it seem like we still haven't formulated the problem correctly in terms of the SOS description. We could use a little help to see what we do wrong.}

\section{New tests with SOSTOOLS}
Different definitions of the sets $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{X}_0$ and $\mathcal{X}_u$ are tested, presented in \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos1}, \ref{fig:intervals_for_sos2} and \ref{fig:intervals_for_sos3}, with varying monomial degrees, and barrier dependency (on $x_1$ alone or on both $x_1$ and $x_{ref}$).

Testing with $\Delta=1$e-4 and $\epsilon=1$e-10. All inequalities are set up as in \autoref{eq:barrier_constraints_putinar}.

Tried to change unit of state from [m] to [cm] (i.e. multiplied limits with scaling factor):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% scaling factor = 1 for [meter], or 100 for [cm]
scaling = 100;

% Distance reference should keep to the unsafe region
delta = 1e-4*scaling;

% Distance which the unsafe region is allowed to deviate from the desired zero
% level set specified by the g(x) defining Xu
epsilon = 1e-10*scaling;

% Set upper and lower limits for the set intervals X, Xu and X0
Xmax = 0.1*scaling;
Xmin = -0.1*scaling;
Xumax = Xmax;
Xumin = 0.05*scaling;
X0max = Xumin-delta;
X0min = Xmin;
\end{lstlisting}
but this gives more or less the same solution, change is leading coefficient increased by an order of degree.

\subsection{Case 1}\label{case1}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{intervals_for_sos1.pdf}
\caption{Only the set $\mathcal{X}$ is defined by both $x_1$ and $x_{ref}$, while $\mathcal{X}_0$ and $\mathcal{X}_u$ are independent of $x_{ref}$.}
\label{fig:intervals_for_sos1}
\end{figure}

With sets defined as in \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos1}:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{X} &= \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.1\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.05-\Delta\end{bmatrix}\\
\mathcal{X}_u &= \begin{bmatrix} 0.05 & 0.1\end{bmatrix} \times \mathbb{R}\\
\mathcal{X}_0 &= \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.05-\Delta\end{bmatrix} \times \mathbb{R}
\end{align}

Letting $B(x_1,x_{ref})$, degree 0:4, gives solution with \texttt{feasratio=1}, while \texttt{numerr=1} in every case (however \texttt{res.norm=8e-7}) and leading term coefficient 1e-4. Plot of $B(x)$ looks "okay" (looks like function of equally much both states). Changing to $B(x_1)$ gives more or less the same except leading term coefficient 3e-9.

In the figures datatips are marking (as close as possible) the zero level set.

\subsection{Case 2}\label{case2}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{All three sets are defined by both $x_1$ and $x_{ref}$, both defined in the same intervals (of the z-axis, corresponding to the slide axis).}
\label{fig:intervals_for_sos2}
\end{figure}

With sets defined as in \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos2}:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{X} &= \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.1\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.1\end{bmatrix}\\
	\mathcal{X}_u &= \begin{bmatrix} 0.05 & 0.1\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} 0.05 & 0.1\end{bmatrix}\\
	\mathcal{X}_0 &= \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.05-\Delta\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.05-\Delta\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

With this definition of the sets, the barrier certificate must be a function of both states: $B(x_1,x_{ref})$. Degree of barrier function tested with 0:2 and 0:4. Yields \texttt{feasratio=1}, \texttt{res.norm=8e-9}, leading coefficients approx 4e-4. However, plot reveals that $B(x)$ looks like it is "almost only" a function of $x_{ref}$ and not $x_1$ -- \textcolor{red}{why???}

Tried to test with the barrier certificate only a function of the robot position: $B(x_1)$: no solution (leding term coefficient 8e-9).

In general for all tests in this case \texttt{feasratio}$\approx 1$, while \texttt{numerr=1} in every case (however \texttt{res.norm} is in general of degree 1e-6 to 1e-9). Also blots of $B(x)$ all looks like it is "much more a function of" $x_{ref}$ than $x_1$, even when monomial degrees for $q$ polynomial-coefficients for $g(x_1)$ functions are set to be larger than those for the $g(x_{ref})$ functions.

%Examples in the figures below.

\label{fig:intervals_for_sos3}
\end{figure}

With sets defined as in \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos1}:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{X} &= \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.1\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 0.1\end{bmatrix}\\
	\mathcal{X}_u &= \begin{bmatrix} 0.05 & 0.1\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} 0.05 & 0.1\end{bmatrix}\\

Results are much the same as for case 2, generally \texttt{feasratio}$\approx 1$, while \texttt{numerr=1} in every case (however \texttt{res.norm} is in general of degree 1e-6 to 1e-9).
