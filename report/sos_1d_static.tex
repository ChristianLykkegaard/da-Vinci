In this and the following chapters, barrier certificates are attempted to be constructed by use of Putinar's Positivstellensatz in \autoref{def:putinar} with the Matlab toolbox SOSTOOLS (see \autoref{app:sostools} for a short introduction to the toolbox). In this chapter the first and second order systems depicted in \autoref{fig:stepresponseslide} are considered with a static reference on the position.




\section{Safety Verification of First Order System}
First a linear open-loop state space system is defined according to the measurement of a step on the robot slide, showing a time constant $\tau=110$\,ms, giving the closed-loop system in \autoref{eq:1storder_1D_ss}:
\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = Ax+Bu = Ax+B(\bar{N}x_{ref}-Kx) = %-\tau^{-1}x+\tau^{-1}u=
-\tau^{-1}x+\tau^{-1}(\bar{N}x_{ref}-Kx)
\label{eq:1D_1storder}
\end{equation} 
which can be recast as the augmented state-space system
\begin{equation}
\dot{\tilde{x}}=
\dot{\begin{bmatrix}
	x_1\\x_{ref}
	\end{bmatrix}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
A-BK&B\bar{N}\\0&0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1\\x_{ref}
\end{bmatrix}
= f_{cl}(x)
\label{eq:xtilde_1storder_1D}
\end{equation}
with no dynamics on the reference. A controller $K$ is found according to pole placement as described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder}, i.e. for the first order 1D system in \autoref{eq:1D_1storder} a controller that is 10 times faster than the system will be $K=9$. Similarly the system scaling factor $\bar{N}$ is determined according to the method described in \autoref{sec:K_Nbar_1D_1storder} as $\bar{N}=10$.
The independent state variables are defined and the SOS program initialized as described in \autoref{sec:app_sostools_barrier_search}.

%Now the $g_j$ functions in \autoref{eq:barrier_constraints_putinar} are constructed according to \autoref{fig:safe:overview}:
%\begin{itemize}
%%\itemsep-1.3mm
%\itemsep-0.7mm
%\item The set $\mathcal{X}$ is defined by constructing a (second order polynomial) function $g_{1}(x_1)\geq 0 \in [\Lambda_{\text{lim}-},\Lambda_{\text{lim}+}]= [-0.1,0.1]$\,m, delimiting the region of possible robot tool positions, and another function $g_2(x_{ref})\geq 0 \in [\Lambda_{h-}+\Delta,\Lambda_{h+}-\Delta]=[-0.1+\Delta,0.05-\Delta]$\,m, delimiting the region of allowable reference positions 
%\end{itemize}

The linear first order system from \autoref{eq:1storder_1D_ss} is defined with the same pole placement controller and thereby system gain as in \autoref{eq:K_1} and \ref{eq:barm_1}, and the same regions/intervals assigned for $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{X}_u$ and $\mathcal{X}_0$ as given in \autoref{fig:safe:overview} - see \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos}.

\caption{Intervals for the 1D case study, where the solid black line represents the interval $\mathcal{X}=\{x_1\in [-0.1, 0.1]\}$, and the interval $\mathcal{X}_0$ defines the interval where $B(x)\leq 0$, while $\mathcal{X}_u$ defines the interval where $B(x)>0$, separated from the zero level set by the small distance $\epsilon$. The interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$ is the interval of positions from which a reference can be taken $x_{ref}\in\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta}$. This interval is slightly smaller than the safe initial set $\mathcal{X}_0$, separated from the zero level set of $B(x)$ by the small distance $\Delta$.}
\label{fig:intervals_for_sos}
\end{figure}

The small $\epsilon>0$ from \autoref{cer2_putinar} is defined "as small as possible", and another small $\Delta>0$ is introduced in order to be test for validity of a controller with references within the interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$ with a distance of at least $\Delta$ to the zero level set of $B(x)$, see \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% Distance reference should keep to the unsafe region
delta = 0.001;

% Distance which the unsafe region is allowed to deviate from the desired zero level set specified by the g(x) defining Xu
epsilon = 0.00001;
\end{lstlisting}
The SOS program is initialized with the augmented state $\tilde{x}$ and thereby vector field as defined in \autoref{eq:xtilde_1storder_1D}. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
% =============================================
% Control Barrier Function Search for 1D system WITH STATIC REFERENCE
pvar x1 xref
xtilde = [x1; xref];

% =============================================
% First, initialize the sum of squares program
prog = sosprogram(xtilde);

% =============================================
% Vector field dt/dx = fx (closed loop)
fx = [A-B*K B*Nbar; 0 0]*xtilde;
\end{lstlisting}
The polynomial $B(x)$ is declared in as small degree "as possible". If any odd-order functions $g_j$ exist, $B(x)$'s leading term should be of an even degree higher than the uneven degree of the leading term of that $g_jq_j$. \textcolor{red}{It is considered that $B(x)$ should only be a function of the position and not of the reference, as the controller is considered as a static position setpoint controller for one single reference, and the program then tests the set of controllers, each with a setpoint within the interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$, for safety.}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]

% Declare polynomial degree of barrier function (FUNCTION OF BOTH X1 AND XREF?)
zB = monomials(x1,0:4);
[prog,Bar] = sospolyvar(prog,zB);
\end{lstlisting}
As $B(x)$ should be valid for the set $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{X}$ is defined by $g_1(x_1)$ being positive on the slide interval, \textcolor{red}{and simultaneously $g_2(x_{ref})$ being positive on the interval $\mathcal{X}_{0\Delta} \subset \mathcal{X}_0$.} See \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos} and \ref{fig:1D_static_gfunctions}.

In the definition of the set $\mathcal{X}$, corresponding to the space where the barrier certificate is valid, also a function $g$ of the reference/setpoint is used. This means that the barrier certificate is valid for all controllers with setpoint within the interval where $g(x_{ref})$ is positive.}

The unsafe set is defined as the interval where the position $x_1$ takes values between 5 and 10\,cm, see \autoref{fig:intervals_for_sos} and \ref{fig:1D_static_gfunctions}. \textcolor{red}{It is not clear whether also the reference should be part of the definition of $\mathcal{X}_u$ (with a $g_2(x_{ref})$ positive on the same interval as $g_1(x_1)$), it has been tested both with and without, but there is no clear indication from the results that is should or should not be included.}

In most cases the solution found has a leading term coefficient of order between -4 and -2, but very often the value of $B(x)$ is either positive or negative on the entire interval [-0.1,0.1]. \textcolor{red}{Strangely, in all tested combinations, $L_{f_{cl}}B(x)$ is positive-valued on an interval approximately [-0.02,0]. This and the fact that the zero level set of the barrier in no case is in $x=0.05$ makes it seem like we still haven't formulated the problem correctly in terms of the SOS description. We could use a little help to see what we do wrong.}
